# Querying Wikipedia's "Good Long Articles" table

This is a simple Python/SQL script whicn creates a database from a list of Wikipedia articles and creates a bar chart showing the century of articles which had years in their titles.
Note that this century has many more events than the 20th century: perhaps more information (ergo longer articles) is available or there is greater interest.
Extracting actual years (and possibly comparing them to byte count?) could provide more detail here.
